Azeroth's Fury

- Went through a few different ideas, but once I started breaking them down I realized the scope was way too ambitions,
  so this was a nice way to make a game that take a lot of what we learned, and allows an obtainable minimum viable product
  while remaining open to more complexity if time allows.

*INSTRUCTIONS*
- Game should be ran in certain resolution terminal: <b>125x26</b>
- Terminal should be displayed with a BLACK background. Some GUI elements may not look correct if not.
- Prompts entered by number only. Type exit at anytime to quit.
- Game auto saves on each combat turn.
- Select a class, or load a previous save file (if new game, previous save is overwritten)
- There are 5 options. Attack normally, Defend against incoming damage, Use special move, Use a health or mana potion.
- Attacking Normally uses no mana, special moves use 50mp each. 
- Potions restore full health or mana and use up your turn. Each enemy drops at least a health potion!
- Proceed on and kill as many enemies as you can!
- Once you die, your score will be presented and you can play again or quit
